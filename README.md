A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.

# Idea and lib used in the project

 - Because this was a simple project, i decided to use Bloc to handle the global state and app business logic

 - Fetch user data from api feature:
  1. I create one data stock and load default 5-6(can custom) user data when start home screen, then i just display about 3-4(can custom) into list carousel, anytime app user skip or favorite any one, i will fetch next(can custom quantity) data to stock and display into list.

 - Favorite feature: You can save to local(SharedPreferences), load from local.
